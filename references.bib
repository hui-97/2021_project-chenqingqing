	abstract = {This paper aims to enrich the standard toolbox for measuring diversity in economics. In so doing, we compare the indicators of diversity used by economists with those used by biologists and ecologists. Ecologists and biologists are concerned about biodiversity: the diversity of organisms that inhabit a given area. Concepts of species diversity such as alpha (diversity within community), beta (diversity across communities) and gamma (diversity due to differences among samples when they are combined into a single sample) have been developed (Whittaker, 1960). Biodiversity is more complex than just the species that are present, it includes species richness and species evenness. Those various aspects of diversity are measured by biodiversity indices such as Simpson’s Diversity Indices, Species Richness Index, Shannon Weaver Diversity Indices, Patil and Taillie Index, Modified Hill’s Ratio. In economics, diversity measures are multi-faceted ranging from inequality (Lorenz curve, Gini coefficient, quintile distribution), to polarisation (Esteban and Ray, 1994; Wolfon, 1994, D’Ambrosio (2001)) and heterogeneity (Alesina, Baqir and Hoxby, 2000). We propose an interdisciplinary comparison between indicators. We review their theoretical background and applications. We provide an assessment of their possible use according to their specific properties.},

	abstract = {Shannon's diversity index H' = Σpi log2 pi was calculated for 267 breeding bird censuses. The index was resolved into its components, species richness and relative abundance, to determine which components played a larger role in the determination of diversity patterns. Changes in diversity were correlated closely with species richness (r = 0.972), while the relative abundance component remained stable. Among the nine community types represented, diversity and species richness increased with foliage height diversity. The relatively abundance component was strikingly low in the marshes due to the presence of gregarious birds which nest in colonies and feed outside the community. Photoplankton differ from birds in that the relative abundance component is not stable from one collection to the next. This is attributed to differences in the environmental uncertainty encountered by the two groups, plankton inhabiting relatively uncertain environments and being 'opportunistic,' while birds occupy predictable environments and therefore 'equilibrium' species. The distribution of relative abundances in birds is more even than in trees, herbaceous—shrub communities, or phytoplankton. Since this is in part the result of intraspecific territoriality, it is predicted that nonbreeding bird populations, species' relative abundances will be less even than they are during the breeding season. It is suggested that the regulation of diversity by either the species richness or relative abundance components represent alternative strategies which are suited to predictable/nonrigorous and unpredictable/rigorous environments, respectively. Therefore, differences similar to those observed between birds and phytoplankton might be expected in other groups of organisms.},

	abstract = {Identifying meaningful locations, such as home or work, from human mobility data has become an increasingly common prerequisite for geographic research. Although location-based services (LBS) and other mobile technology have rapidly grown in recent years, it can be challenging to infer meaningful places from such data, which – compared to conventional datasets – can be devoid of context. Existing approaches are often developed ad-hoc and can lack transparency and reproducibility. To address this, we introduce an R package for inferring home locations from LBS data. The package implements pre-existing algorithms and provides building blocks to make writing algorithmic ‘recipes’ more convenient. We evaluate this approach by analyzing a de-identified LBS dataset from Singapore that aims to balance ethics and privacy with the research goal of identifying meaningful locations. We show that ensemble approaches, combining multiple algorithms, can be especially valuable in this regard as the resulting patterns of inferred home locations closely correlate with the distribution of residential population. We hope this package, and others like it, will contribute to an increase in use and sharing of comparable algorithms, research code and data. This will increase transparency and reproducibility in mobility analyses and further the ongoing discourse around ethical big data research.},

	abstract = {Traditional approaches to human mobility analysis in Geography often rely on census or survey data that is resource-intensive to collect and often has a limited spatio-temporal scope. The advent of new technologies (e.g. geosocial media platforms) provides opportunities to overcome these limitations and, if properly leveraged, can yield more granular insights about human mobility. In this paper, we use an anonymized Twitter dataset collected in Singapore from 2012 to 2016 to investigate this potential to help understand the footprints of urban neighbourhoods from both a spatial and a relational perspective. We construct home-to-destination networks of individual users based on their inferred home locations. In aggregated form, these networks allow us to analyze three specific mobility indicators at the neighbourhood level, namely the distance, diversity, and direction of urban interactions. By mapping these three indicators of the spatial footprint of each neighbourhood, we can capture the nuances in the position of individual neighbourhoods within the larger urban network. An exploratory spatial regression reveals that socio-economic characteristics (e.g. share of rental housing) and the built environment (i.e. land use) only partially explain these three indicators and a residual analysis points to the need to explicitly include each neighbourhood's position within the transportation network in future work.},
